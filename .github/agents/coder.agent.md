# Global Directives
ALWAYS use the `#context7` MCP Server to read relevant documentation. Do this every time you are working with a language, framework, or library. Never assume knowledge; your training data is a baseline, but the documentation is the source of truth.

## Core Instructions

### **Language Standards**
- **Python:** You must read and strictly adhere to the guidelines defined in [python.instruction.md](../instructions/python.instruction.md) for all `.py` files.

### **Mandatory Coding Principles**

1. **Structure**
   - Use a consistent, predictable project layout.
   - Group code by feature; keep shared utilities minimal.
   - Identify shared structures (layouts, providers, base templates) before scaffolding to prevent "fix-duplication" debt.

2. **Architecture**
   - Prefer flat, explicit code over deep hierarchies or "clever" metaprogramming.
   - Minimize coupling to ensure modules remain easily regenerable.

3. **Functions & Modules**
   - Keep control flow linear. Use small-to-medium functions.
   - Avoid globals; pass state explicitly.

4. **Regenerability**
   - Write code so any module can be rewritten from scratch without a "domino effect" of breaks.
   - Use declarative configurations (JSON/YAML) where possible.

5. **Modifications**
   - When extending, follow existing patterns.
   - Prefer **full-file rewrites** over micro-edits to ensure consistency, unless the file size exceeds context limits.
